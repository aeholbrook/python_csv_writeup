This document will explain several different methods for performing simple data manipulation tasks on the attached `cereal.csv` dataset. Covered in this notebook are:

*   base python list manipulation
*   base python list comprehension
*   pandas 
*   an R language solution

Also included is a brief overview of the `time` library, which is used here to provide a simple comparison of the run time of these algorithms.
