        "##Intro\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we talked today about the basics of csv imports and working with datasets, I thought I'd put together a brief notebook detailing some different ways to work with lists and how they affect performance. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###Python stuff\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook introduces a few essential python tools, including the `time` library, responsible for reading the system clock and measuring the passage of time. We'll be using it to compare the efficiency of different pieces of code. \n",
        "\n",
        "I'm also going to briefly cover the python library `pandas`, which will be discussed in the next lesson, and show you how to do this same assignment in that context. I think you'll see why `pandas` is such a useful tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "###R Stuff\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I'm going to show you how to do this same assignment in another popular data science language, `R`. I think that even though `python` is a great primary language and will likely soon become *lingua franca* in the Data Science community, there are still a lot of folks using `R`, especially those working in research and science. I used it a quite often when I was a neuroscience researcher. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In introducing `R`, I'll show you one of the coolest things that `notebooks` can do, which is called `%line magic%`. Put simply, the specific flavor we'll be using, `rmagic`, allows you to switch seamlessly between `R` code and `python` code directly in the notebook. There are a lot of other uses for this, but here we'll just stick with this one application. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###Why You Should Read This\n",
        "\n",
        "My hope with this write-up is that you'll see that:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   There are a lot of ways to solve the same problem with code. Just because someone else does it differently doesn't mean you did it wrong.\n",
        "*   Code can be used in a litany of ways, but sometimes writing code to emphasize performance and 'prettiness' can be detrimental to the readability of your code. Fancy $\\neq$ readable!\n",
        "*   The same skills you're developing now in `python` are just as easily applied to other languages like `R` with much less effort than it took to learn your first language. When you see a job posting that calls for a language like `R`, `SAS`, or `MatLab`, don't fret! By the end of this course you'll be closer to proficient in these languages than you think!\n",

        "##Loading Extensions and Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start by loading the `rpy2` extension. You don't really need to know much about this, other than that it's responsible for allowing `R` and `python` to interact with each other later on. It's generally good practice to start off by loading & importing all the dependencies you're going to need for your code later on. Also, if you've got a lot of code and you're importing as needed, you might import the same thing a few times, or reimport it under a different name. This can make your code run slower or not at all, and can make things confusing to others reading what you've made!\n",
        "\n",
        "We're also going to be importing the following `python` libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `os`, which is responsible for interacting with your computer's operating system. This is the library that'll let us `open` and `read` files.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `csv`, which is what allows `python` to read and interpret `.csv`, or `comma-separated values` files. Our `cereal.csv` file is one of these.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `time`, which introduces tools responsible for reading the system clock and measuring the passage of time."

        "\n",
        "First, our `with` statement is allowing us to catch `exceptions` in our code block without completely stopping our code from running. \n",
        "\n",
        "Second, our `open()` function is telling `python` to read the file at the address denoted by `cereal_csv`. `newline=''` involves a lower-level function of the reader and tells `python` how to handle different types of line separators - we don't need to worry about this very much right now.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, we are taking the object which we just created using the `open()` function and giving it the name `csvfile`. This object is an `iterable`, with each piece of that `iterable` being a `line` in the `cereal.csv` file.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "  csvreader = csv.reader(csvfilem, deliiter=\",\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "We are creating a `reader` object which is an `iterable` based upon the contents of the opened `csvreader` object. We are also telling the code that the items in the `csv` are separated, or delimited, by - you guessed it - a comma! We'll talk a little more about what that `iterable` property means below:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",

        "```\n",
        "It may be a little beyond the scope of this course to talk in-depth about *how* the `next()` function works, but essentially any object that is `iterable` does so because it has a roadmap that tells `python` how to get from one value to another. This is usually a straight line, from item 1, to item 2, etc. The `iterator` also has something like a `cursor`, which keeps track of where you're at in that list of items. `next()` basically returns the item that `cursor` is pointing at, then moves the `cursor` to wherever the roadmap tells it to go next. This is why `csv_header` contains the file's header, but `csvreader` now starts off on the line immediately following the header, since it's still connected to the `csvfile` object.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "  print(f\"header: {csv_header}\")\n",

        "```\n",
        "  for row in csvreader:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Since `csvreader` is an `iterable`, we can use a `for loop` on it. This basically tells `python` to loop through every item (in this case, each row from our `cereal.csv`), and for each item it gets, do something with it. It temporarily gives the item the name `row`. Here, each `row` object is a `python` `list`, basically a series of values which can be `iterated` through or selected individually.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "    if float(row[7]) >= 5:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Now that we have our `row` objects, everything in the `for loop` will be performed on one row from `csvreader` at a time. So let's talk about what this statement will do to an individual `row`:\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we select `row[7]` - counterintuitively, the 8th item in the `row` object. This is because when we `index` - or select by position - in `python`, we do so starting with item number `0`. As we will see later, this is not the case in every language `R` `iterables` start at `1`. \n",
        "\n",
        "We need to convert the item from its current data type (a `string` of characters) to something which `python` can compare to other numbers. This means using some `numeric` data type, like `int` or `float`. \n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the items in the `fiber` column contain decimal values, like `1.5`. These can't be precisely represented as `integers`, since python may round the number or otherwise not represent it properly, so we'll need to make sure to have `python` `cast` - or convert - the value into a `float`. That's what `float()` does. \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we will use a comparison to determine whether the `float` we just retrieved is greater than or equal to `5`. Greater than or equal to is expressed as `>=` in `python`. When we're using an `if` statement, we want whatever's after it to be either `True` or `False`. This `>=` comparator will return one of these, and the code contained in the `if` statement will be executed if that value is `True`."

        "\n",

        "We have the same `path` set in our `cereal_csv` variable here, since we're accessing the same file, so the first time our code differs here is when we read our `csv` file. `pandas` does a lot of work for us here - I added the `sep` argument in manually even though commas are the default delimiter. It also `infer`s the header type by default, but if you would like to use the `cereal_bonus.csv` file here, you would only need to change that argument to `header=False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we are making here, in fact, is a `pandas` `data_frame` object. As you're working with it, you might recognize its similarity to the native `python` `dict` object. \n",
        "\n",
        "Since `pandas` has already taken care of the header, we don't need to worry about using the `next()` function to pull it out of our data. We just print out the header stored in the `cereal_data_frame` object:\n",

        "Basically, we're taking our `cereal_data_frame` object and getting its `iloc` attribute. This attribute is also called `index-location` and allows us to select specific `slices` from our `DataFrame` object. Here our slice has two components, with order `[` `rows`,`columns` `]`: The first - `:` - is a shorthand for `all indices`; we select every row in the `DataFrame`. The second - `7` - indicates we select the 8th column. When we put these two statements together, they mean \"Select the 8th column from every row in `cereal_data_frame`.\". Pandas then lets us directly determine which of these items are greater than or equal to 5 using the same `>= 5` statement as above. \n",
